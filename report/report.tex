\section{Introduction}
It is know that since ancient times humankind humankind has made an effort to
catalogue the stars visible in the sky, from the $36$ stars listed in the
\"three stars each\" by the ancient Babylonians in the $2000s\ B.C.$
\cite{astronomy:history:dick}; to the last full-sky catalogue to date with over
$1.5$ billion objects, the Gaia Data Release 3\cite{gaia:dr3}, made available
to the public on June 13, 2022, by the European Space Agency.

With the advent of modern telescopes and satellites, the capability to detect
even the dimest lights from space have reached heights previously unthinkable.
The gaia catalogue is but one of the many catalogues available to date, which
serves to illustrate sheer quantity of data currently collected. Current
telescopes are constantly surveing the sky in search for evermore objects to study.

This massive volume of data means that most of it will never get to be studied
by hand by astronomers, instead better focusing their effors studying object 
that are already known to possess qualities that may result of special interest.
In order to identify these special observations from the sea of data available,
multiple techniques have been developed.\cite{pulsar:dataset:oxford} In the 
current paper, data from a specialized pulsar catalogue\cite{pulsar:dataset},
is approached using multiple Arificial Intelligence techniques in order to
identify possible pulsar star candidates.

\section{The Problem}
The name Pulsar (from \underline{Puls}ating st\underline{ar}) refers to a
type of neutron star with powerfull magnetic fields.\cite{pulsar:definition:nasa}
This field accelerates particles that may ultimately get thrown into the magnetic
poles poles of its star, heating them. This heat gradient may be so high that
the poles may act as hotspots radiating massives amount of heat into space,
distinctively more than that of the rest of the star. As the star spins, 
these beams of electromagnetic waves (mostly on the X-ray spectrum) go in and out
of view from earth at extremely regular periods, motion that makes it appear as
pulsating in the sky, thus, giving it its name.
